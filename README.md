# 🏁 TrackCraft: AI Coach for Racing Telemetry

TrackCraft is a Python-based tool that delivers lap-by-lap feedback for racing drivers.  
It currently analyzes braking behavior — including entry speed, brake pressure, and braking duration — to tell you which lap and technique performed best in each corner.

### 🧭 What's Next?
In future releases, we plan to integrate additional performance metrics like:
- 🌀 Lateral and longitudinal G-forces
- 🦶 Throttle application and release timing
- 🛞 Steering input trends

These insights will help drivers build a complete picture of their car control and racecraft.
